 Status code 200:               1000
 
-In the above example, we simulated 100 users hitting the same URL 10 times, a total of 1000 transactions. The elapsed time is measured from the first transaction to the last, in this case it took 617.99 seconds to hit the http server 1000 times.  During that run, siege recieved a total of 4848000 bytes including headers.  The response time is measured by the duration of each transaction divided by the number of transactions.  The transaction rate is number of transactions divided by elapsed time.  Throughput is the measure of bytes recieved divided by elapsed time.  And the concurrency is the time of each transaction divided by the elapsed time.  The final statistic is Status code 200.  This is the number of pages that were effectively delivered without server errors.

 To create this example, I ran siege on my Sun workstation and I pounded a GNU/Linux Intel box, essentially a workstation.  The performance leaves a lot to be desired.  One indication that the server is struggling is the high concurrency.  The longer the transaction, the higher the concurrency.  This server is taking a while to complete the transaction and it continues to open new sockets to handle all the additional requests.  In truth the Linux box is suffering from a lack of RAM, it has about 200MB, hardly enough to be handling one hundred concurrent users. :-)
